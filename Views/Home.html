    <p>	Why-How-What.  Simon Sinek stated that great leaders start with why, rather than what.  Why am I here?  I want to empower people with great technologies
    in order for them to achieve their goals and desires.  How do I accomplish this?  By working to the best of my ability, constantly learn new technologies, and
    bettering myself on a daily basis.  So what do I do?  I'm a developer.  I attend Indiana University pursuing a bachelors degree in Computer Science, a certificate
    in Informatics, and a minor in business.  I don't plan on stopping there, however.  After graduating, I will be working to earn my Masters in Information Systems,
    and later down the road my Masters in Business Administration.  I want to continue to work my way up, as I do not believe in complacency, while giving back to
    those around me.</p>
